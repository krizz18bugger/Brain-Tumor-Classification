This project implements a deep learning–based brain tumor classification model trained on MRI images. The model classifies tumors into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and notumor.

The final trained model achieved an overall accuracy of 88%, with strong precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes. Notably, the model performed exceptionally well on notumor and pituitary classes, while maintaining good generalization across the dataset. The evaluation also shows a high AUC-ROC of 0.98, indicating excellent discriminative ability.

The trained model, dataset preprocessing steps, and evaluation scripts are included in this repository for reproducibility and further enhancement.
